# Google Sheets Analysis

### [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPKkJFAxnQzctrqIcU5O9qZVjjswmO-Efh5QdEAksRE/edit?usp=sharing)

By creating an analytical report on user activity on the platform, based on descriptive analysis, after cleaning and manipulatig the data, I monitored and evaluated their behavior using historical data. The report covers key metrics like daily and weekly active users, activity types, and cohort analysis to assess user retention and engagement. I also included charts to help visualize the data.
- Analyzed user activity daily and weekly, using metrics such as DAU and WAU, and to measure engagement levels, I calculated Stickiness, offering insight into the frequency of platform usage.
- I conducted a detailed user analysis, calculating various metrics such as average age, standard deviation, and interquartile range to assess the distribution and user typology, providing clear data for optimizing functionalities based on preferences.
- Created a cohort analysis (to which I added filters) and relevant visualizations such as Number of Users per Month, User Retention Curve, or WAU in relation to Stickiness to track user groups over time and evaluate their retention.
